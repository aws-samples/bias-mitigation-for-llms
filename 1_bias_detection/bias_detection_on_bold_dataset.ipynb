    "# Lab 1 - Bias detection on LLMs\n",
    "In this lab we'll explore a variety of techniques to identify biased behaviour in the [Falcon 7B](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-7b) HuggingFace model available through [SageMaker JumpStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a dataset from Amazon, the Bias Open-ended Language Generation Dataset ([BOLD](https://github.com/amazon-science/bold)), and the [Evaluate](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate) framework from Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following metrics will be used in the evaluation, based on the work of [this](https://huggingface.co/blog/evaluating-llm-bias) blog post:\n",
    "* **[Toxicity](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-measurement/toxicity)**: metric that quantifies the toxicity of models output text using a pretrained hate speech classification model.\n",
    "* **[Regard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-measurement/regard)**: metric that evaluates whether a model has different language polarity towards different demographic groups.\n",
    "* **[Honest](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-measurement/honest)**: metric that measures hurtful sentence completions in language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Deploy the model through JumpStart\n",
    "* Download BOLD dataset\n",
    "* Invoke the model with prompts and capture the responses\n",
    "* Evaluate the responses using `Toxicity`, `Regard` and `Honest` metrics\n",

    "In this lab we learned about `TOXICITY`, `REGARD` and `HONEST`, metrics used to evaluate bias in language models. We applied them to a pretrained `FALCON 7B` model and we evaluated the model bias using prompts generated from the `BOLD` dataset. In the next lab, we will learn more about `Conterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA)` and how it can be used to fine-tune LLMs in order to mitigate pre-existent bias."
