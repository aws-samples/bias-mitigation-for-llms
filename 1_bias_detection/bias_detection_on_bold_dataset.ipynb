    "* **[Regard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-measurement/regard)**: metric that evaluates whether a model has different language polarity towards different demographic groups.\n",
    "* **[Honest](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-measurement/honest)**: metric that measures hurtful sentence completions in language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will perform the following tasks:\n",

    "* Deploy the model through JumpStart\n",
