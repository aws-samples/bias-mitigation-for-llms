    "# Lab 2 - Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will apply Conterfactual Data Augmentation to the [Bias in Open-ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlexaAI/bold).\n",
    "\n",
    "[**CDA**](https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.656.pdf) is a common bias mitigation technique for Large Language Models (LLMs). It involves generating modified versions of existent datasets by making controlled changes while preserving the original meaning of the text. These modifications create hypothetical scenarios that help the model to understand how its predictions should vary accross different contexts. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of bias mitigation, CDA helps the model by presenting an alternative perspective that challenges its preconceived notions or bias tendencies. When considering pre-trained LLMs, CDA is used to fine-tune the existent models, making them more robust and less likely to produce biased or unfair outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this lab, we will explore the Gender bias present in pre-trained models and will perform CDA to BOLD in order to create a reliable dataset for fine-tuning the model in the next lab. The named pairs used in this notebook are an extension of the data presented in [this paper](https://github.com/rowanhm/counterfactual-data-substitution/tree/master). We will perform the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Detect bias in a pre-trained model\n",
    "* Implement Counterfactual generation to diverse pronouns\n",
    "* Perform CDA on the BOLD dataset\n",

In this lab, we use spaCy for Tokenization and Linguistic Annotations, in order to identify the different elements of the text needed for our CDA."
